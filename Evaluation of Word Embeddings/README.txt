Hello Professor Diana Inkpen and TA!

This is Group 14's submission for Assignment 1 Part 2.

The Assignment 1 Part 2.ipynb file has the code for reading all files using glob and iterating through each filename one by one.

For every filename we go through a set of embedding/encoding process and then we output it to a File which has the name of the model.
For eg. InferSentSTS2016.input.answer-answer.
Hope you like the pipeline created for each model in the ipynb!

Each such file is then compared to the gold dataset file using correlation.perl script.
Finally all scores were taken for the files and included in the report.

Thank you!
